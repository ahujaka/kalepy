## To-Do
- **Optimization desperately needed**.  Things are done in (generally) the simplest ways, currently, need to be optimized for performance (both speed and memory [e.g. with reflections]).  Especially in the case of finite-support kernels, the calculations can be drastically sped up.  Can also use an approximation for infinite-support kernels, truncating at some threshold value of sigma (or percentile; etc).
- Use `sp.stats.rv_continuous` as base-class for 'Distribution' to provide functionality like 'ppf' etc.
- `kalepy/`
    - Allow for calculating PDF and resampling in only particular dimensions/parameters.
        - FIX: Doesn't work quite right for non-fixed bandwidth, bandwidth needs to be re-calculated for different number of dimensions
    - Re-enable the `Kernel.pdf_grid` method, and have `KDE.pdf_grid` call that.
    - `tests/`
        - No tests currently check that proper errors are raised.
        - Make sure tests check both cases of `num_points > num_data` and visa-versa (e.g. in PDF calculation).
    - `kernels.py`
        - Use meta-classes to register subclasses of `Distribution`.


## Known-Issues
- Differences between covariance-matrix elements of numerous orders of magnitude can cause spurious results, in particular in the PDF marginalized over parameters.  See "KDE::Dynamic Range" docstrings.  Currently this is checked for in the `KDE._finalize()` method, at the end of initialization, and a warning is given if the dynamic range seems too large. 



## Current
- Created a logo using the `kalepy` package to smooth over rendered letters.  New notebook `logo.ipynb` and data files.  Logo media files added to 'docs' and to the `README`.

- `kalepy/`
    - `kde_base.py`
        - `class KDE`
            - Addition (uncaught) keyword-arguments are passed from `KDE` initialization to `Kernel` initialization, so that additional arguments (e.g. `chunk`) can be passed along.

            - Implemented 'chunking' for resampling calculation.  Currently only reflection.

        - `save_fig()`  [new-function]
            - Save a `matplotlib` figure adding convenience features.
- `docs/`
    - `logo/`
        - Logo associated data files.
