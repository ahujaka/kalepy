## To-Do
- Optimization drastically needed.  Things are done in (generally) the simplest ways, currently, need to be optimized for performance (both speed and memory [e.g. with reflections]).
- Use `sp.stats.rv_continuous` as base-class for 'Distribution' to provide functionality like 'ppf' etc.
- `kalepy/`
    - Allow for calculating PDF and resampling in only particular dimensions/parameters.
        - FIX: Doesn't work quite right for non-fixed bandwidth, bandwidth needs to be re-calculated for different number of dimensions
    - Re-enable the `Kernel.pdf_grid` method, and have `KDE.pdf_grid` call that.
    - `tests/`
        - No tests currently check that proper errors are raised.
        - Make sure tests check both cases of `num_points > num_data` and visa-versa (e.g. in PDF calculation).
    - `kernels.py`
        - Use meta-classes to register subclasses of `Distribution`.

    - `kernels.py`  [new-file]
        - Stores classes and methods for handling the kernels and their underlying distribution functions.
        - NOTE: some of the scaling and normalization does not work properly in multi-dimensions for all kernels.
        - `class Kernel`
            - Stores a covariance-matrix and uses it as needed with a `Distribution` class instance.
        - `class Distribution`
            - Subclassed to implement particular distribution functions to use in a kernel.
            - Agnostic of the data and covariance.  The `Kernel` class handles the covariance matrix and appropriately transforming the data.

        - `get_distribution_class()`
